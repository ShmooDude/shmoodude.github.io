For this project, I created a vignette for the financial API at [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/docs/options/getting-started).  It can pull aggregate data using more relaxed rules than the web API.  One thing I found interesting was that the two stocks I looked at, the volume of transactions compared to the percentage gain on a given day seemed to have similar, non-constant variance, but with different starting points.

I didn't necessarily find any of the logic difficult so much as finding what I want to do difficult.  I started from a point of designing the functions without thinking about the end result of what I wanted to do with them (the exploratory data analysis).  If I were to do a similar project in the future, I would try to make sure I have a more solid knowledge of what data I wanted to get before starting to design the functions.
