## Final thoughts

Now that I've used it a lot, I think R works well for data science.  When I started the course, I generally only preferred SAS for doing the actual statistics but R for doing plots and graphics.  Now I think I'll use R a lot more.  The added flexibility compared to SAS with regard to output is nice and rmarkdown is so much easier to do than SAS reports.

In practice, I'm going to use the tidyverse a lot more.  Prior to this course, I was familiar with ggplot but not the rest of the tidyverse.  The tidyverse and piping are pretty amazing, although I do wish that the Assignment operator %<>% was enabled when doing a library(tidyverse).  The magrittr package isn't loaded by default with tidyverse and only the base pipe is reexported (I think that's the right term).

I'm interested in learning about more machine learning methods.  Althoug there are some limitations to machine learning, using processing power to solve problems sounds very interesting to me.
